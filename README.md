# tictactoe_using_RL

# Purpose:
This project aims to develop an AI agent capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe through reinforcement learning. By training a deep neural network with the Q-learning algorithm, the agent will learn to make successful moves by receiving rewards for its decisions in the game environment. The project involves designing and implementing the neural network, collecting and preprocessing data, and training the model through various iterations to optimize its behavior. Once trained, the agent will be able to play Tic-Tac-Toe effectively and efficiently, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning in creating intelligent agents. The project will also include a comparative analysis of the agent's performance against other reinforcement learning approaches and baseline models. Overall, the project seeks to explore the potential of reinforcement learning in creating agents capable of learning and adapting to complex environments.
